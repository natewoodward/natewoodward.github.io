This guide will show you how to create a Jekyll blog on GitHub pages.
We'll set up syntax highlighting, mark up and style some pages,
work around GitHub's lack of `jekyll-last-modified-at` support,
and do a bit of SEO along the way.


1. TOC

### Requirements

### Add Some Pages

#### Home Page
#### Blog Index
#### Blog Entry

### Polish Your Site

### Add More Functionality

#### Last Modified Dates

### Optionally Set Up a Custom Domain

Unfortunately, the `jekyll-last-modified-at` plugin isn't currently supported on Github Pages.
Let's implement similar functionality using a Git `pre-commit` hook.
