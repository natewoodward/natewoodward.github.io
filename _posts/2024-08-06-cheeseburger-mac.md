Some friends asked for this recipe and I don't have an account on one of those
recipe sites so I am posting it here.
The idea is to make a cheeseburger flavored mac and cheese
using a technique from
[Chef John's cheeseburger stromboli recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzaNHC-ckzQ)
applied to one of
[Babish's basic mac & cheese recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUeyrEN14Rk).

### Ingredients

* 4 chopped bacon slices (optional)
* 1/2 lb ground beef
* 1C diced onion (optional)
* pepper to taste
* a pinch of cayenne
* 1/2C diced pickle
* 2 tbsp ketchup
* 1 tbsp mustard
* 3C milk
* 3C water
* 1 tsp worcestershire sauce
* salt to taste
* 1 lb macaroni
* 3-4C shredded cheddar

### Instructions

Put a large pot on medium heat.

Optionally, fry the bacon in the bottom of the pot, then remove the bacon,
set it aside, and stir it in with the cheese at the end of the recipe.

Add the beef to the pot and brown it.
Optionally, add the onion once the beef starts browning.

Once the beef is brown and onion is translucent,
add the pepper, cayenne, pickles, ketchup,
and mustard. Mix and let heat for half a minute or so.

Add the milk, water, salt, and worcestershire. Bring to a simmer.

Add the macaroni and reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Stir occasionally.

Once the macaroni is cooked through and the liquids have reduced to a
saucy texture, turn off the heat, stir in the cheese, and adjust salt to taste.
