Let's do it again then, what the heck. You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy.

You need the dark in order to show the light. We need dark in order to show light. We'll make some happy little bushes here.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# global variables
prog="${0##*/}"
usage="Syntax: $prog [world]" 

# parse and check args
world="$1"
if [[ -z "$world" || "$*" == *'--help'* ]]; then
	echo "$usage" >&2
	exit 1
fi

# say hi
echo "hello $world"
```

Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. This is a fantastic little painting. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. This is your world.

A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. Just use the old one inch brush. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.

Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. You can get away with a lot. There comes a nice little fluffer. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue.

Fluff that up. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.
